                    Yes! When you create a team, you automatically get a 14 day free trial in which
                    you can cancel at any time without paying a dime.

                <h4 class="mb-3">Can I cancel my subscription?</h4>
                <p class="light-font mb-5">
                    Absolutely! We charge on a monthly basis because we know that most volleyball
                    seasons are not year round. Therefore you should only pay for the months that
                    you use the service.

                <h4 class="mb-3">What payment methods do you accept?</h4>
                <p class="light-font mb-5">
                    We accept all major credit cards and process the payments through Stripe. You
                    will get an invoice in your email for every payment we process.
                </p>

                <p class="light-font mb-5">
                    Doctor Volleyball has two Modes: Inseason and Offseason. Changing your account
                    to Offseason Mode stops all payments but prevents you from recording stats on
                    new games. All your data is still available in offseason mode and will be
                    indefinitely.
