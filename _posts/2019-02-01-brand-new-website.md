I am so pleased to announce that we have a new website!

Doctor Volleyball began as a pet project to help me take stats while coaching. Over the years it has evolved as I have over-engineered the app countless times, drawn up business plan after business plan and redesigned everything many times over. This is my latest effort in a redesign.

I hope that this new website will showcase the application better, providing screenshots and a more coherent FAQ. This blog is also an added bonus, as I no longer have to redirect customers to my own personal blog that has a section on my efforts with Doctor Volleyball.

If you are interested in joining this journey with me, let me know by contacting me at [info@doctorvolleyball.com](mailto:info@doctorvolleyball.com).
